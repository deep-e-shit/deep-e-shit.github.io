            <p>In an alternate timeline, open-source software reshaped civilization. Code was free, knowledge was accessible, and innovation flowed like an unchained river. But in this timeline—our timeline—that revolution never arrived. Not because it couldn’t, but because it wasn’t allowed to.</p>
            <p>Open-source software had the potential to be the great equalizer. It stood for everything that could have empowered individuals: free knowledge, borderless collaboration, and innovation unrestricted by financial gatekeepers. It wasn’t just about software; it was about a new world order where technology belonged to the people, not to shareholders. And yet, here we are, living in a world where the most powerful open-source projects are slowly being enclosed, controlled, and diluted by the very forces they set out to defy.</p>
            <p><h3>The Early Uprising: A Dream of Digital Liberation</h3></p>
            <p>The origins of open-source software were nothing short of revolutionary. The GNU Project, Linux, and the Apache Foundation proved that great things could be built in the open, without corporate control. The movement gained traction as developers across the globe came together, bound by a shared belief in transparency and community-driven progress. It was a golden era—an intellectual renaissance in which merit, not money, dictated progress.</p>
            <p>For a moment, it seemed inevitable that open-source software would dismantle the monopolies that dictated the rules of technology. It wasn’t just about code—it was about power. Decentralized systems, free software, and open data had the potential to create a world where no single entity could hoard innovation for itself. But the world we live in is not dictated by potential. It is dictated by capital.</p>
            <p><h3>The Hijacking: How Corporations Swallowed the Open-Source Ideal</h3></p>
            <p>Tech giants didn’t ignore the rise of open-source—they absorbed it. They played the long game, not by fighting open-source software outright, but by co-opting it. They embraced the optics of open-source, only to twist its purpose. They provided funding, hired key maintainers, and subtly shifted projects towards their own interests. They turned open-source into a farm—an endless supply of free labor and ideas that could be monetized without giving back to the people who made it possible.</p>
            <p>Take Kubernetes, React, TensorFlow—great open-source projects, but who truly controls them? They live under corporate stewardship, maintained by teams whose salaries come from the very entities open-source once sought to dismantle. Even Linux, the poster child of the movement, is now heavily influenced by corporations through the Linux Foundation.</p>
            <p>Licensing was the next battleground. The promise of ‘free and open software’ started eroding as projects adopted more restrictive licenses to prevent corporations from exploiting them without compensation. But the damage was already done. The most powerful open-source projects had already become tools for the same monopolies they once threatened.</p>
            <p><h3>The End of the Uprising: When Open Became a Marketing Term</h3></p>
            <p>The tragic irony is that open-source won—but in doing so, it lost. Instead of breaking the dominance of tech giants, it became their engine. The movement’s brightest minds were hired, its projects absorbed, its ethos repackaged as a PR strategy.</p>
            <p>The promise of a world where software was free and innovation was unconstrained never fully materialized. Why? Because those who stood to lose the most—the entrenched corporations, the investors, the policymakers who benefit from artificial scarcity—ensured that it didn’t. Open-source was allowed to exist, but never to truly flourish. It became the illusion of freedom rather than the real thing.</p>
            <p><h3>The Road Not Taken</h3></p>
            <p>What could have been different? A world where open-source wasn’t just a free resource for tech monopolies, but a true counterforce. Where open protocols dominated instead of walled gardens. Where decentralized, community-driven software dictated the pace of progress, not corporate-controlled roadmaps.</p>
            <p>But that’s not our world. Instead, we exist in a reality where open-source software is a battleground, where the ideals of freedom and accessibility are constantly eroded by financial interests.</p>
            <p>The revolution never happened. It was bought out.</p>
